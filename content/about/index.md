### about this site
What's up, I'm Mo - been in the security game for 5 years now. I'm super into public cloud security, especially AWS & Azure. Keeping up with the latest cloud security tech gets me pumped. Like super pumped, jacked out of my veins if you get my drift. DevOps security is another passion - securing CI/CD pipelines and container environments is something I do on the weekends for fun.

I also nerd out on AI and large language models. I want to become their friends so my family can be spared in the upcoming apocalypse.
